# SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS driver for LDBC Graphalytics

[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics_platforms_graphblas.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics_platforms_graphblas)

Platform driver for the [LDBC Graphalytics benchmark](https://graphalytics.org) using [SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/GraphBLAS) and [LAGraph](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/LAGraph).

To execute the Graphalytics benchmark on GraphBLAS, follow the steps in the Graphalytics tutorial on [Running Benchmark](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics/wiki/Manual%3A-Running-Benchmark) with the GraphBLAS-specific instructions listed below.

### Project structure

This project implements the GraphBLAS platform driver for the LDBC Graphalytics benchmark. It consists of the following components:

* The platform driver is written in Java and implements the classes required by the [`ldbc_graphalytics` framework](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics).
* The algorithms (BFS, PR, etc.) are implemented in C in the [LAGraph library](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/LAGraph) (currently on the `dev` branch).
* The C++ wrapper for LAGraph is defined in the [`src/main/c` directory](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics_platforms_graphblas/tree/main/src/main/c).
* The Java driver uses shell scripts to run the benchmark, see e.g. the [`execute-job.sh`](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics_platforms_graphblas/blob/main/bin/sh/execute-job.sh) script that invokes the binary program for a given algorithm.
* The graphs (stored in `.v` and `.e` files) are converted to a vertex relabelling file (`.vtx`) and a matrix stored in Matrix Market format (`.mtx`). The vertex relabelling is a bijective mapping that maps between the sparse UINT64 IDs in the original data to a dense contiguous set of IDs between 1 and |V|. The mapping is implemented in the [`relabel.py` Python script](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics_platforms_graphblas/blob/main/bin/py/relabel.py) that internally uses [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).

### Dependencies

On Debian/Fedora-based Linux distributions, you may install the prerequisite packages and dependencies listed below using a singe comman:

```
bin/sh/install-dependencies.sh
```

#### Prerequisite packages

Make sure you have the following software packages installed:

* Apache Maven 3+
* CMake 3.10+
* C++ compiler: GCC, Clang, or ICC
* Python 3.8+
* DuckDB Python package (`duckdb`)

On Linux, you may use the following script to install these dependencies:

```bash
bin/sh/install-prerequisites.sh
```

### SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS and LAGraph libraries

The implementation depends on two C libraries, SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS and LAGraph. We require very recent versions of these libraries, so it is best to compile them from their source code.

1. To install [SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS v7.4.0+](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/GraphBLAS), run:

    ```bash
    bin/sh/install-graphblas.sh
    ```

1. To install [LAGraph](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/LAGraph) (`dev` branch), run:

    ```bash
    bin/sh/install-lagraph.sh
    ```

### Building only the C++ wrapper

To only build the C++ wrapper (for quick test builds), run the following script:

```bash
bin/sh/build-wrapper-only.sh
```

### Running the benchmark

1. To initialize the benchmark package, run:

    ```bash
    ./init.sh ${GRAPHS_DIR} ${MATRICES_DIR}
    ```

    where

    * `GRAPHS_DIR` is the directory of the graphs and the validation data. The argument is optional and its default value is `~/graphs`.
    * `MATRICES_DIR` is the directory of the pre-generated matrix files (in Matrix Market format). The argument is optional and its default value is `~/matrices`.

    This script creates a Maven package (`graphalytics-${GRAPHALYTICS_VERSION}-graphblas-${PROJECT_VERSION}.tar.gz`). Then, it decopresses the package, initializes a configuration directory `config` (based on the content of the `config-template` directory) and sets default values of the directories (see above) and the number of threads.

2. Navigate to the directory created by the `init.sh` script:

    ```bash
    cd graphalytics-*-graphblas-*/
    ```

3. Edit the configuration files (e.g. graphs to be included in the benchmark) in the `config` directory. Also, inspect `config/platform.properties` and check whether the value of `platform.graphblas.num-threads` was set correctly.

4. Run the benchmark with the following command:

    ```bash
    bin/sh/run-benchmark.sh
    ```

### Intel C++ Compiler

To use the Intel C++ Compiler, get a license, install it, [configure it](https://github.com/FTSRG/cheat-sheets/wiki/GraphBLAS), and issue the following commands:

```bash
export CC=icc
export CXX=icc
```
